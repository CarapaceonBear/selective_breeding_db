# selective_breeding_db
## DFESW10 Final Project - Database project mocking selective breeding in imaginary creatures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Why are we doing this?

This is a final project to affirm that I have learnt the skills given to me throughout the QA course. Specifically it demonstrates:
- Setting up a database with CRUD functionality
- Creating a Java project with Spring Boot API
- Unit and integration testing
- Http requests with Postman
- Continuous integration with Github, using feature branches
- Project management with Jira
- Building .jar file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### How I expected the challenge to go
#### Day one thoughts:
I am comfortable with the technologies involved, so most of the project should be quite manageable. I struggle with testing, so I intend to allocate extra time for that.<br>
#### Day three thoughts:
I have got all the functionality in code done, and I'm happy with my progress. I wanted some more sophisticated functions going on with the query results, and I feel I've managed this.<br>
I'm keeping up with regular version control, and upkeep of my Jira board.<br>
The next couple of days are for writing tests.<br>
This leaves the final day for any stretch goals, and for readying the project for submission - compiled build, tidied repo, filled-in readme.<br>
#### End of project thoughts:
I'm happy with the functionality of my code, I have achieved what I set out to do.<br>
Testing was tricky, but I achieved significant coverage. It was worth alotting extra time for it in my plan.<br>
My stretch-goals were a bit idealistic, in areas I wasn't already familiar, and not realistic within the timeframe<br>
I feel the project demonstrates well my understanding of the course topics.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What went well?
 - I judged my speed well during the planning stage, with reasonable story points. This meant that I closely followed the plan I set out.
 - Coding core functionality was comfortable for me, and I am pleased with the end results.
 - For all the time it took, testing was successful. I have a stronger understanding than when I started this week.
### What didn't go as planned?
 - There were some topics that I hadn't understood as well as I thought, such as building .jar files, so took some extra time.
 - Some concepts, like risk assessments, were touched on very early in the course, so I had to take some extra time to revise them.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project
 - I started to break complex queries into separate classes, for better Single Responsibility, and this could be taken further.
 - In terms of version control, I should have used more branches, for individual features. Instead to pulling to main, each feature should have been pulled to a develop branch.
