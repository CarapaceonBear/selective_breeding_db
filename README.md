# selective_breeding_db
DFESW10 Final Project - Database project mocking selective breeding in imaginary creatures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Why are we doing this?**
This is a final project to affirm that I have learnt the skills given to me throughout the QA course. Specifically it demonstrates:
- Setting up a database with CRUD functionality
- Creating a Java project with Spring Boot API
- Unit and integration testing
- Http requests with Postman
- Continuous integration with Github, using feature branches
- Project management with Jira
- Building .jar file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**How I expected the challenge to go**
Day one thoughts: 
I am comfortable with the technologies involved, so most of the project should be quite manageable. I struggle with testing, so I intend to allocate extra time for that.
End of project thoughts:
