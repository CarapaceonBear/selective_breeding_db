# selective_breeding_db
## DFESW10 Final Project - Database project mocking selective breeding in imaginary creatures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Why are we doing this?

This is a final project to affirm that I have learnt the skills given to me throughout the QA course. Specifically it demonstrates:
- Setting up a database with CRUD functionality
- Creating a Java project with Spring Boot API
- Unit and integration testing
- Http requests with Postman
- Continuous integration with Github, using feature branches
- Project management with Jira
- Building .jar file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### How I expected the challenge to go
#### Day one thoughts:
I am comfortable with the technologies involved, so most of the project should be quite manageable. I struggle with testing, so I intend to allocate extra time for that.<br>
#### Day three thoughts:
I have got all the functionality in code done, and I'm happy with my progress. I wanted some more sophisticated functions going on with the query results, and I feel I've managed this.<br>
I'm keeping up with regular version control, and upkeep of my Jira board.<br>
The next couple of days are for writing tests.<br>
This leaves the final day for any stretch goals, and for readying the project for submission - compiled build, tidied repo, filled-in readme.<br>
#### End of project thoughts:
I'm happy with the functionality of my code, I have achieved what I set out to do.<br>
Testing was tricky, but I achieved significant coverage. It was worth alotting extra time for it in my plan.<br>
I feel the project demonstrates well my understanding of the course topics, at least those directly relevant.
