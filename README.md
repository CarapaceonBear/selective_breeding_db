# selective_breeding_db
## DFESW10 Final Project - Database project mocking selective breeding in imaginary creatures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Why are we doing this?

This is a final project to affirm that I have learnt the skills given to me throughout the QA course. Specifically it demonstrates:
- Setting up a database with CRUD functionality
- Creating a Java project with Spring Boot API
- Unit and integration testing
- Http requests with Postman
- Continuous integration with Github, using feature branches
- Project management with Jira
- Building .jar file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### How I expected the challenge to go
#### Day one thoughts:
I am comfortable with the technologies involved, so most of the project should be quite manageable. I struggle with testing, so I intend to allocate extra time for that.<br>
#### Day three thoughts:
I have got all the functionality in code done, and I'm happy with my progress. I wanted some more sophisticated functions going on with the query results, and I feel I've managed this.<br>
I'm keeping up with regular version control, and upkeep of my Jira board.<br>
The next couple of days are for writing tests.<br>
This leaves the final day for any stretch goals, and for readying the project for submission - compiled build, tidied repo, filled-in readme.<br>
#### End of project thoughts:
I'm happy with the functionality of my code, I have achieved what I set out to do.<br>
Testing was tricky, but I achieved significant coverage. It was worth alotting extra time for it in my plan.<br>
My stretch-goals were a bit idealistic, in areas I wasn't already familiar, and not realistic within the timeframe<br>
I feel the project demonstrates well my understanding of the course topics.<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What went well?
 - I judged my speed well during the planning stage, with reasonable story points. This meant that I closely followed the plan I set out.
 - Coding core functionality was comfortable for me, and I am pleased with the end results.
 - For all the time it took, testing was successful. I have a stronger understanding than when I started this week.
### What didn't go as planned?
 - There were some topics that I hadn't understood as well as I thought, such as building .jar files, so took some extra time.
 - Some concepts, like risk assessments, were touched on very early in the course, so I had to take some extra time to revise them.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Possible improvements for future revisions of the project
 - I started to break complex queries into separate classes, for better Single Responsibility, and this could be taken further.
 - In terms of version control, I should have used more branches, for individual features. Instead to pulling to main, each feature should have been pulled to a develop branch.
 - DTOs could be incorporated, as they are a 'stretch goal' in the project specifications, though we didn't have time to cover them in the course, so some extra time is required to familiarise myself with them.

### Risk Assessment
| Description | Evaluation | Likelihood | Impact Level | Responsibility | Response | Control Measures |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Inaccurate story points in project plan | Project overruns deadline | Medium | High | Project planner | Re-evaluate project priorities | Revise story points at regular intervals |
| Development PC breaks | Short delay / day's work lost | Low | Low | Developer | Switch to new device | Have alternative device in ready (laptop) |
| Eye-strain, back pain | Effect on developer health | Low | Medium | Developer | Reduce workload | Take regular short breaks |
| Procrastination / Distraction | Slow work | Medium | Medium | Developer | Change work environment | Reduce distractions |
| Sprint too big | Too much to accomplish, deadline missed | Low | High | Project planner | Remove tasks from sprint | Keep scope reasonable |
| Version control not followed | Lost work | Low | High | Developer | Re-do work | Push to feature branch with every change or Jira task |
| Power outage | Lost work / wasted time | Low | High | Developer | Find a temporary work space | Acceptance - out of our control |
| Issues in code / lesser understanding of concepts | Slow work | Medium | Medium | Developer | Seek advice from instructor / colleagues | Set reasonable targets in planning stage |
