# selective_breeding_db
DFESW10 Final Project - Database project mocking selective breeding in imaginary creatures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Why are we doing this?**

This is a final project to affirm that I have learnt the skills given to me throughout the QA course. Specifically it demonstrates:
- Setting up a database with CRUD functionality
- Creating a Java project with Spring Boot API
- Unit and integration testing
- Http requests with Postman
- Continuous integration with Github, using feature branches
- Project management with Jira
- Building .jar file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**How I expected the challenge to go**

Day one thoughts: 
I am comfortable with the technologies involved, so most of the project should be quite manageable. I struggle with testing, so I intend to allocate extra time for that.
Day three thoughts:
I have got all the functionality in code done, and I'm happy with my progress. I wanted some more sophisticated functions going on with the query results, and I feel I've managed this. 
I'm keeping up with regular version control, and upkeep of my Jira board.
The next couple of days are for writing tests. 
This leaves the final day for any stretch goals, and for readying the project for submission - compiled build, tidied repo, filled-in readme.
End of project thoughts:
